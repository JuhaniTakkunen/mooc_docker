Now that we’ve warmed up it’s time to get inside a container while it’s running!
Start image devopsdockeruh/exec_bash_exercise, it will start a container with clock-like features and create a log. Go inside the container and use tail -f ./logs.txt to follow the logs. Every 15 seconds the clock will send you a “secret message”.
Submit the secret message and command(s) given as your answer.
